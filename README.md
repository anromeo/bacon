This is a quick throw app that I used to learn rspec and test::unit testing.  The difference between the two involves integration testing, which looks at the different parts of an app and tests each feature.  This is also known as BDD or Behavior Driven Development Testing.  The other testing, which I use less of is Test Driven Testing.  This particular type of testing looks at the entire app and makes sure it's working from there.  I preferrably like to work with BDD because I feel it is more encompassing than TDD though BDD takes longer to implement.
